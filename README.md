# README

Build by selecting "Create Lambda SAM Application" in the AWS Toolkit for Visual Studio Code under Explorer by left-clicking three dots.

Structure function to work with virtual environments so dependencies are visible in IDE but not included in ZIP because .aws-sam folder already contains them as a result of `sam build`.
